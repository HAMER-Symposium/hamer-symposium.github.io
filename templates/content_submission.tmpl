  <h2> Submissions </h2>
      We are soliciting proposals for presentations. Please prepare an abstract of
      up to 1500 characters describing research you would like to present. 
      This research may have been previously published, but we also welcome presentations
      about ongoing research or industry experience. 
      <br /><br />
      Our intention is to accommodate all reasonable presentations as talks. If the number of 
      reasonable submissions exceeds the available talk slots, we
      will also hold a poster session for all submissions, regardless of whether they are also
      selected for a talk slot or not.
      <br /><br />
