  <h2> Abstract Submissions </h2>
      We are inviting abstract submissions for presentations at HAMER 2026. Please prepare an abstract of
      up to 1500 characters describing research you would like to present. 
      This research may have been previously published, but we also welcome presentations
      about ongoing research or industry experience. 
      <br /><br />
      Our intention is to accommodate all reasonable presentations as talks. If the number of 
      abstract submissions exceeds the available slots for oral presentations, we
      will also hold a poster session for all submitted abstracts.
      <br /><br />
